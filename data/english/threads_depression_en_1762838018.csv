I took medication for depression for almost forty years until God told me to start exercising which was no easy feat as I have back and knee issues. I stopped taking my depression medication after two weeks and I no long take any medication for depression. When you exercise it releases endorphins in your brain and changes your mindset. I promise you it works. You need to also kick your abusive husband to the curb. I had one of those too.
